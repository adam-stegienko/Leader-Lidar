# Leader Lidar

#### Project Overview

The project aim was to check my knowledge about Jenkins CI pipelines creation, as well as building a complex Java application based on self-created dependencies which were first built with Maven Project Build Tool and then stored in JFrog artifactory.
The whole project was divided into four major parts: Analytics module (dependency), Telemetry module (dependency), End-to-End Testing module (testing of all modules), and Product module (a final module combining Analytics, Telemetry, and End-to-End Testing modules.)
